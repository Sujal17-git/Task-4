# Task-4
Task-2 AI-ML Internship By Elevate Labs

Choose Dataset:
→ Loaded the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from sklearn.datasets for binary classification (malignant vs. benign).

Train/Test Split & Standardize:
→ Split the dataset into training and test sets, then standardized features using StandardScaler to normalize input data.

Fit Logistic Regression:
→ Trained a LogisticRegression model using the scaled training data.

Evaluate Model:
→ Predicted labels and probabilities, then calculated confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to measure performance.

Tune Threshold & Explain Sigmoid:
→ Adjusted classification threshold to observe metric changes and explained how the sigmoid function outputs class probabilities
